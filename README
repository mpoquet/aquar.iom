Dependencies
============
    C++14 compiler
        clang 3.4 or higher should be good (tested on clang3.7.1-1)
        g++ 5 or higher can also be used (tested on g++5.3.0-3)
    Qt 5 (tested on 5.5.1-9)
    SWIG 3.0.8
    SFML 2.3.2 (tested on 2.3.2-3)
        Looks like it needs to be compiled from scratch on debian-like distributions.
        List of needed packages to compile it (debian):
            libudev-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev libxcb-image0-dev
            libudev-dev libjpeg-dev libfretype6-dev libopenal-dev
            libflac-dev libvorbis-dev
    Python 3 (tested on 3.5m). Python 2.7+ might work but it has not been tested at all.
    JDK (tested on openjdk8.u74-1)

Automatic build & export
========================
    Two scripts in the 'redist' directory can be used to compile everything
    and to export all what is needed into a directory containing:
        - the server binary
        - the visualisation binary
        - a directory which contains everything to use a C++ bot example
        - a directory which contains everything to use a Python bot example
        - a directory which contains everything to use a Java bot example

    Compile everything
    ==================
        cd redist
        bash -e build_everything.sh

    Export
    ======
        cd redist
        bash -e create_redist.sh
        # Creates a directory ./aquariom

Manual Installation

User manuals
============
    Server
    ======
    The server has a little Command Line Interface.
    Typing 'help' in it should display the list of available options.
    Its command-line options can be shown with --help or -h.

    Visu
    ====
    The visualization has many shortkeys.
    More details can be found in file 'visu/readme.txt'.
    Its command-line options can be shown with --help or -h.
